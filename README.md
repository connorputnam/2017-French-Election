<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repo is to visualize the 2017 French Presidential election. Users can choose to run the files in this repo and display the visualizations locally or use the provided link below to see a deployed Shiny Document.

The primary visualization was created using the package `ggvis` to interactively illustrate the landslide victory Emmanuel Marcon of the EnMarche! party achieved over his opponent Marine Le Pen of the National Front party. It can be found in the file named `ggvis_map.Rmd`. The code for the remaining two visualizations along with the deployable Shiny document can be found in `ggvis_document.Rmd`. All of the data used in this project are included in the folder labeled `Data`.
